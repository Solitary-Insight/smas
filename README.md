 Smart Multi-Agent Scheduler (SMAS)

Smart Multi-Agent Scheduler (SMAS) is an AI-powered orchestration system designed to automate and optimize academic scheduling for university staff, teachers, and students. Unlike traditional manual or semi-automated tools, SMAS utilizes autonomous agents to resolve complex logistical conflicts and maximize resource efficiency in real-time.
 The Problem

Academic scheduling is often plagued by overlapping time slots, limited room availability, and shifting faculty preferences. Manual scheduling is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to inefficiencies and resource waste.
The Solution

SMAS leverages Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to represent different stakeholders (students, faculty, facilities) as digital agents. These agents negotiate intelligently to create a balanced, flexible, and conflict-free schedule.
 Key Features

    AI-Powered Optimization: Uses smart negotiation and scheduling algorithms to find the best possible time-resource fit.

    Real-Time Conflict Resolution: Automatically detects and fixes scheduling overlaps as they happen.

    Live Updates: Instantly pushes changes to all stakeholders to ensure everyone is on the same page.

    Resource Management: Wisely allocates classrooms, labs, and equipment to prevent underutilization.

    User-Centric Design: A clean, intuitive interface tailored for the needs of university administration and students alike.
